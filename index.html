                    I have started typing along and haven't been too sure what it means.  I am learning the the more that I 
                    try to be something that I'm not, I end up swimming even harder.  I need to learn to trust the way that the 
                    world wants me to turn, not to relinquish control but to hand over trust.  <br><br><em>Trust is the only way flowers
                    grow</em>

                    Unfortunately, the way that people think about themselves tends to make us smaller than we really are.
                    We do not see ourselves as what we really are and I wish that we did.  I've always wanted to be something 
                    that I am not but it is not the way that the world works.  Oftentimes people get lost in themselves, 
                    imagining that they are somthing else, when, like a plant, the greatest way to grow is to accept our current
                    position and move through it.

                    To grow our plants, we have to trust that they'll tell us when they're hungry
                    why can't we trust ourselves to do the same thing.
