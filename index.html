            <h2>This Is The Start</h2>
                <p>I have started typing along and haven't been too sure what it means.  I am learning the the more that I 
                    try to be something that I'm not, I end up swimming even harder.  I need to learn to trust the way that the 
                    world wants me to turn, not to relinquish control but to hand over trust.  <em>Trust is the only way flowers
                    grow</em>

            <h2>Life of a Gardener</h2>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the way that people think about themselves tends to make us smaller than we really are.
                    We do not see ourselves as what we really are and I wish that we did.  I've always wanted to be something 
                    that I am not but it is not the way that the world works.  Oftentimes people get lost in themselves, 
                    imagining that they are somthing else, when, like a plant, the greatest way to grow is to accept our current
                    position and move through it.

                    To grow our plants, we have to trust that they'll tell us when they're hungry<br>
                    why can't we trust ourselves to do the same thing.
